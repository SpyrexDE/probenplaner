## Migration Guide

To migrate from the old codebase to the new one:

1. Run the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Run the asset copy script:
   ```
   php copy-assets.php
   ```

3. Import any existing data using the provided database scripts.

4. Test the application thoroughly.

## Backwards Compatibility Notes

The new codebase maintains the same functionality as the original application while improving its structure and maintainability. Users should experience no change in the core functionality, but will benefit from improved security and performance.
